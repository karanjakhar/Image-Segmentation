# Image-Segmentation

Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very
difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of
clinical scenarios. AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.  Implemented an Encoder - Decoder architecture to learn relative mask for an image.
